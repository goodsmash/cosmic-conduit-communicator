# The Catastrophe and Decision to Intervene

The catalyst for the Aethel's temporal communication stems from a catastrophic event in their timeline - one so significant that it threatened not just their civilization, but the very fabric of space-time. This section explores both the nature of this catastrophe and the complex decision-making process that led to their intervention.

## The Catastrophic Event

- Nature and scope of the disaster
- Immediate and long-term consequences
- Failed attempts at local timeline solutions
- Discovery of temporal communication possibilities

## The Intervention Decision

The choice to reach back through time was not made lightly. The Aethel understood the delicate nature of temporal mechanics and the potential risks of creating paradoxes or unintended consequences. Their decision-making process involved:

- Extensive modeling of timeline variations
- Development of non-invasive communication methods
- Creation of ethical frameworks for temporal intervention
- Implementation of safeguards against temporal paradoxes
